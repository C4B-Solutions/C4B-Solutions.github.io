JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter
This module saves you (and others!) time in three ways:
 - No configuration. The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your project. Just drop it in.
 - Automatically format code. Just run standard --fix and say goodbye to messy or inconsistent code.
 - Catch style issues & programmer errors early. Save precious code review time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.
